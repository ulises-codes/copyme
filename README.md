# Copy Me! by Ulises Himely

## A memory game

This is a very simple memory game that uses a `WebWorker` to handle most of the game logic and the `Web Audio API` to generate tones when the user touches a pad.
I reached for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) in this project for its lightweight and simple API. For the spring animations, I just used `svelte/motion`.
